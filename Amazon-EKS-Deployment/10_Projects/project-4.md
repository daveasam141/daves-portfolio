*Project 1:*
•⁠  ⁠Install external DNS within your EKS cluster.
•⁠  ⁠Verify its functionality.

‼️Tips For Project 1: Create a domain name with any of the following providers:

•⁠  ⁠AWS Route53 
•⁠  ⁠Cloudflare
•⁠  ⁠GoDaddy

I will choose Cloudflare over the other providers. Create API key and API token.

*Project 2:*
•⁠  ⁠Install Jira on Kubernetes using the Helm chart.
•⁠  ⁠Ensure you use ClusterIP in your Jira Helm values.
•⁠  ⁠Integrate Jira with the MSSQL server installed in Project 1 to provision the backend database.
•⁠  ⁠Verify that your Jira installation is working correctly.

*Project 3:*
•⁠  ⁠State three good reasons why a fully qualified domain is necessary to access your service or app.
•⁠  ⁠Describe what DNS is and why it's needed.
•⁠  ⁠⁠Engage in an open-ended discussion among yourselves during the working session via Zoom. Ensure that everyone participates.
